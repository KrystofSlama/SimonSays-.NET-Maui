# SimonSays-.NET-Maui
A simple cross-platform implementation of the classic Simon Says memory game, developed during the second semester of my bachelorâ€™s studies. The game challenges players to memorize and repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. Built using .NET MAUI, it runs on multiple platforms with a responsive UI and basic game logic, making it a beginner-friendly demonstration of cross-platform development principles.
Features:
Randomly generated color sequences.
Increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
Interactive, responsive UI using .NET MAUI controls.
Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
